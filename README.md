# Timetracker - React/ AWS Amplify Version

Add projects and tasks then track time spent on them.

## Work Suspended..
This project was 95% complete but ran into large problems committing time events back to the databasae (DynamoDb via AppSync). I need to switch over to Azure anyway so I'll leave this project for now. 

I'ms starting an Angular/Azure version - see [https://github.com/severalpens/tasktimetracker](https://github.com/severalpens/tasktimetracker)
